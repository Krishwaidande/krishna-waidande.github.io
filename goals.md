## Goals of the learning plan 

`Hello Readers,`

Today's post is a bit different from my earlier blogs. Today I will be sharing my learning plans which I have set for 90 days.
Also will share the what are goals behind this learning plan.

### First let's start with what are my learning plans??

+ Improve email writing skills. 

+ Learn advance concepts of Apache HTTP web server.

+ Database designing.

+ Get better at Linux commands.

The goal behind choosing the above topics are, I want to improve the things in which I am poor, also want to make a habit of self-learning.
`Knowledge is the thing that never wastes`. So I am just trying to learn and gain knowledge by learning as much as I can get.

### Finally let me list down concrete goals :

+ The mail writing skills have to improve to that level where I can send a mail to clients or any other person without reviewing it from my colleagues.

+ I will able to design a good schema of database and get idea of important concepts like index, joins, etc..

+ Knowledge of more than 35+ advanceed Linux commands and their usage with all options.

### Keep learning :)
