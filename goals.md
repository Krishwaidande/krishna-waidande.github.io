## Goals of leaning plan 


Hello Readers,

Today's post is little different from my earlier blogs.Today I will be sharing my learning plans which I have set for 90 days.
Also will share the what are goals behind this learning plan.

First let's start with what are my learning plans??

> Improve Email writing 

> Learn Advance concepts of Apache server.

> Design Database

> Get better at Linux Command.

Goal behind choosing the above things are I want to improve the things in which I am poor, also want to make a habbit of self learning.
Knowledge is the thing that never waste. We never know which knowledge will help us in which condition.
So I am just trying to learn and gain knowledge by leaning as much as I can get.

Finally let me list down concrete goals :

> After 90 days if I send a mail to someone for review, I want get less no of comments (2-3) or No comments :)

> I will able to design a good schema of database and get idea of important concepts like index, joins, etc..

> Knowledge of more than 30+ commands and their usage with all options.

### Keep leanrning :)
