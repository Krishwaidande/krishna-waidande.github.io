## Professional Email Basics.

Hello readers, 

Many of us faces the problem in email writting. How should we organize the email? what things we can avoid while writting
emails? what are our mistakes in email? these are most common questions which comes to our mind. 
Let's try to find answer of them in the following blog.

## Email Dos : 

+ Subject line must be clear and brief.

+ Do add words of appreciation especially when making request.

+ Keep email text size upto 2-3 paragraphs.

+ Use excerpts from previous messages to clarify what youâ€™re replying to.

+ Have a professional Email id.


**Bad ones** : `silentkiller@gmail.com, KrishSwimmeer@gmail.com`


**Good ones** : `krishnawaidande@gmail.com, swapnil@gmail.com`


## Email Don'ts

+ Make mistakes like spelling, grammer, punctuation, capatalization.

+ Write long emails. It should contain 2-3 paragraphs.

+ Complaint or blame in the email.

+ Address the email until it is written ( It means don't use send button untill it is checked.)

+ Assume that everyone reads email immediately



## Points to remember :

+ After writing emails, come back and again read the whole email. Edit the words and try to short them.

+ Hava a clear order.

+ Avoid harsh words.

+ Never use passive voice mostly use active voice.

+ Never use extra words.Try to eliminate the extra words, we use more adjectives and adverbs. Don't use them.


While writing email most of us use the punctuations at wrong places and we never come to know about it, if we do not know
where to use them, as like I have used in this sentense. Also most of use do not capitalization in the mail. We will discuss 
about it in following segment of blog.


## Puncatualization and Capatalization

+ Apostrophe **(')**

You can use apostrophe in the context of possession it mean Krishna's laptop, Swapnil's mobile.
Avoid to use this in words like can't or wouldn't.


+ Commas **(,)**

If you pause there is where commas should go or you are listing something there should be comma used.

For example :

> My best friend, Joe, arrived.

> C, C++, Java are my favourite languages.

> In date octomber 10, 1018


+ Semicolan ;

Use semicolan when writing a series like Recent Olympic sites are `Pune, India; UK, London; US, America`.


+ Quotatation marks **(" ")**

> Do not use for emphasis

`I would "really" like to meet you. ( Do not use)`


> Use for direct speech only 
 

`He said, "I wil come with you."`


+ Emoticons 

Don't use Emoticons in the email.

+ Capitalization :

Mostly we do a mistake like never use the first letter as a capital for a nouns or word after full stop or starting letter
of every new sentense.
For example :

Invalid : `redhat and ubuntu are popular flavours of linux operating system.`

Valid : `Redhat and Ubuntu are popular flavours of Linux operating system.`

Here Rehat, Ubuntu and Linux are proper nouns.

Invalid : `i will be coming late to the office.`

Valid : `I will be coming late to the office.`

Here first letter of newline sentense should be capital.


I hope now the questioned which we raised earlier in the article are answered.
