## Professional Email Basics.

Hello readers, 

Many of us faces the problem in email writting. How should we organize the email? what things we can avoid while writting
emails? what are our mistakes in email? these are most common questions which comes to our mind. 
Let's try to find answer of them in the following blog.

## Do's : 

+ Subject line must be clear and brief.

+ Do add words of appreciation especially when making request.

+ Keep email text size upto 2-3 paragraphs.

+ Have a professional Email id.


**Bad ones** : `silentkiller@gmail.com, KrishSwimmeer@gmail.com`


**Good ones** : `krishnawaidande@gmail.com, swapnil@gmail.com`


## Don'ts

+ Make mistakes like spelling, grammer, punctuation, capatalization.

+ Write long emails. It should contain 2-3 paragraphs.

+ Complaint or blame in the email.

+ Address the email until it is written ( It means don't use send button untill it is checked.)



## Points to remember :

While writing email most of us use the punctuations at wrong places and we never come to know about it, if we do not know
where to use them, as like I have used in this sentense. Also most of use do not capitalization in the mail. We will discuss 
about it in following segment of blog.
