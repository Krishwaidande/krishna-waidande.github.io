# Docker

Hi Readers,

What is Docker?

Docker is a software platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
It allows developers to package up an application with all the parts it needs in a container, and then ship it out as one package.



How we can use this into our OpenSpecimen?

To run our OpenSpecimen we required a set of softwares/dependencies like Tomcat, MySQL/Oracle, Apache, Java, and main our OpenSpecimen app.
We do all the required software installation manually, what if we can merge all softwares into single package, and then where ever we need to install OpenSpecimen
we just need to put this single package into the remote machine. and done.

Deployment will happen within few mins.

What is container?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
