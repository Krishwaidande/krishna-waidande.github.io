# How to track your daily tasks?

Hello readers,

This may be the biggest question for most of us.Someone of you might forget the things and later faces the consequences of it.


For example :


Consider a scenario you are working on something and suddenly some other important task comes on your desk. so you move onto that other task & start working on it. It took half a day of your and after completion of this task, you have given next task, (In this process you lose the track of your very first task) you complete your next task and went to the home. 
Here is a thing you forget the task which was assigned to you at the start of the day.


Now next day Boss / Manager ask you about the task you forgot. 
:) 


What you will do now ?? you will tell them something and they will think you are making excuses and all. you will go frustrated, you will think I do so much of work then also Boss / Manager scolds me and all.


Now think if you keep the track of your task would this situation occur?


Probably not unless you forget to keep the track of your task :)


In our daily busy schedule. It is very difficult to remember all the things we want to do in that particular day so some of us might use the notebook for this to keep the track of a task or maintains to-do list in their mobile app or in their personal diary.


But what if I tell you, I have overcome this problem of tracking the daily tasks.


There are so many softwares on the internet which gives you the functionality of keeping track of your task.Let me list them.

Many more...
Most of them are paid sofwares :(


There are few softwares in the market which are free of cost, provide different features & easy to use.

Let me tell you about the software I am using to keep track of my task.

#### History.


Trello was released at a [TechCrunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch) event by Fog Creek founder [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky).

In 2015, Trello launched third-party integrations with tools such as Slack, GitHub and Salesforce for its paying users. In 2016, Trello opened this platform to additional developers with the launch of its "Power-Ups Platform" for developers wanting to integrate their services with Trello.
