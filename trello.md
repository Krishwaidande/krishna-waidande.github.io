# How to track your daily tasks?

Hello readers,

This may be the biggest question for most of us. Someone of you might forget the things and later faces the consequences of it.


Consider a scenario you are working on something and suddenly some other important task comes on your desk. so you move onto that other task & start working on it. It took half a day of your and after completion of this task, you have given next task, (In this process you lose the track of your very first task) you complete your next task and went to the home. 
Here is a thing you forget the task which was assigned to you at the start of the day.


Now next day Boss / Manager ask you about the task you forgot. **:)** 


What you will do now ?? you will tell them something and they will think you are making excuses and all. You will become frustrated. 


Now think if you keep the track of your task would this situation occur?


Probably not unless you forget to keep the track of your task  **:)**


In our daily busy schedule. It is very difficult to remember all the things we want to do in that particular day so some of us might use the personal diary to keep the track of a task or maintains to-do list in their mobile app.


But what if I tell you, I have overcome this problem of tracking the daily tasks.


There are so many software on the internet which gives you the functionality of keeping track of your task.

Many more...
Most of them are paid software **:(**


There are more software in the market which are free of cost, provide different features & easy to use.

Let me tell you about the software I am using to keep track of my task.

Let me tell you a short history of trello


### History of Trello


Trello has released at a [TechCrunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch) event by Fog Creek founder [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky).

In 2015, Trello launched third-party integrations with tools such as Slack, GitHub, and Salesforce for its paying users. In 2016, Trello opened this platform to additional developers with the launch of its "Power-Ups Platform" for developers wanting to integrate their services with Trello.

On January 9, 2017, Atlassian announced its intent to acquire Trello for $425 million. The transaction was made with $360 million in cash, while the remaining $65 million was made with shares and options.


I started to use Trello a few months back. It really helps me to keep track of my task. On Trello we can create a board, cards, to-do list and much more things. I update my Trello board regularly. so it help me to remember all the task.

There are 4 sections on my Trello board. 

+ `TO-DO`: When any new task assigns to me I create a ticket for this task and put under the TO-DO list.


+ `Doing`: I keep those tickets under Doing list on which I am currently working on.I maintain a status of the current task in this ticket. I make note of my task here. so later also if I come on this task after a day or 2-3 days later I can recall all the things.


+ `On-Hold`: Suppose any task postponed, as like any meeting with the client or we have sent a mail to the client about requirements so until requirements come from a client this task goes on On-Hold.


+ `Done`: As a completion of my task, I move the task ticket to done.


Now let me tell you how did Trello help me to keep track of my daily task.

My Experience : 

I am working as technical staff at Krishagni. My role is to upgrade the client servers & install our OpenSpecimen product on client server.
The Installation process is a little bit long process. We need to ask the client about providing us with an environment to install OpenSpecimen, this process takes a long time all the conversation happens in the emails.
So we need to maintain the status of each client.If Trello were not there it was so difficult for me to keep track of all the clients. 
Sometimes client or we forgot to take follow-ups on the mails. but as we can see a ticket is the On-Hold state on Trello board from a long time. it helps us to take follow-up of emails.



Now I think you get the answer to the question of  "How to keep track of your task? "
