# How to track your daily tasks?

Hello readers,

This may be the biggest question for most of us.Someone of you might forget the things and later faces the consequences of it.


Consider a scenario you are working on something and suddenly some other important task comes on your desk. so you move onto that other task & start working on it. It took half a day of your and after completion of this task, you have given next task, (In this process you lose the track of your very first task) you complete your next task and went to the home. 
Here is a thing you forget the task which was assigned to you at the start of the day.


Now next day Boss / Manager ask you about the task you forgot. 
:) 


What you will do now ?? you will tell them something and they will think you are making excuses and all. You will become frustrated. 


Now think if you keep the track of your task would this situation occur?


Probably not unless you forget to keep the track of your task 
## :)


In our daily busy schedule. It is very difficult to remember all the things we want to do in that particular day so some of us might use the personal diary to keep the track of a task or maintains to-do list in their mobile app.


But what if I tell you, I have overcome this problem of tracking the daily tasks.


There are so many softwares on the internet which gives you the functionality of keeping track of your task.

Most of them are paid sofwares 
## :(


There are few softwares in the market which are free of cost, provide different features & easy to use.

Let me tell you about the software I am using to keep track of my task.


## [TRELLO](https://trello.com)

Let me tell you a short history of trello


### History of Trello


Trello was released at a [TechCrunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch) event by Fog Creek founder [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky).

In 2015, Trello launched third-party integrations with tools such as Slack, GitHub and Salesforce for its paying users. In 2016, Trello opened this platform to additional developers with the launch of its "Power-Ups Platform" for developers wanting to integrate their services with Trello.

On January 9, 2017, Atlassian announced its intent to acquire Trello for $425 million. The transaction was made with $360 million in cash, while the remaining $65 million was made with shares and options.


I started to use trello a few months back. It really helps me to keep track of my task. On Trello we can create a board, cards, to-do list and much more things. I update my Trello board regularly. so it help me to remember all the task.

There are 4 sections on my Trello board. 

+ TO-DO : When any new task assigns to me I put that task in this list. I create a ticket for this task and put this unnder TO-DO list.


+ Doing : I keep those tickets under Doing list on which I am currently working on.I matain a status of the current task in this ticket.Status means upto what I have convered in this task. I make note of my task here. so later also if I come on this task I can recall all the things.


+ On-Hold : Suppose any task postponded. as like any meeting with client. or we have sent a mail to client about requirements.so untill requirements comes from client this task goes on On-Hold.


+ Done : As a completion of my task I move the task ticket to done.


Now let me tell you how did trello helped me to keep track of my daily task.

My Experience : 

```
I am working as technical staff at Krishagni company. My role is to upgrade the client servers & install our OpenSpecimen product on client server.
Installation process is a little bit long process.We need to ask client about provide us with a environment to install OpenSpecimen, this process takes a long time all the conversation happens on the emails.
So we need to maintain the status of each client.If Trello were not there it was so difficult for me to keep track of all the clients. 
Sometimes client or we forgot to take follow-ups on the mails. but as we can see a ticket is on-Hold state on Trello board from longer time. it helps us to take folloe-up of emails.
